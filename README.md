# WordPress website

I'm sharing the code for my website because it showcases how to correctly use WordPress in a (somewhat) secure manner.


## About the code

Front-end assets have been compiled for the latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge, and Safari 11. Also, the theme uses CSS grids which means unsupported browsers will get the mobile layout.

Basically, outdated and obscure browsers are not a concern of mine.

Basically, you can study the code as much as you like. You may use everything outside the `themes/crean` folder without restrictions - consider it public domain. But the theme contains my branding and that I claim full copyrights for. **Do not reuse my logo.** The rest you can use however you'd like.
